#
# Purpose: script invoked by execution nodes with one command-line arguement
#	   this script accomplishes one evaluation
#
# Invocation: $./execute.sh language
#		the language can be any of the following: java, c, python2, python3, cpp, cpp14
#
# Arguments: The first(and only) argument provides the language chosen by the student.
#            This will be appended to the the language specific compilation and
#            execution files.
#
# Dependencies: proper setup of test_cases/checks, test_cases/setup and test_cases/tests
#		see README.txt for more details
#
# Output:	results/log.txt		evaluation log
#		results/scores.txt	marks of each test case on a new line
#		results/comment.txt	comments of each test case on a new line
#
#	Variable definitions
#	--------------------

# All variables that are exported/imported are in upper case convention. They are:
#   TESTLOG : temporary test log file that holds compile and run-time logs from each test
#   LOG : temporary log file that collects compile and run-time logs from all tests
#   LANGUAGE : language in which the student has submitted an evaluation request
#	  TESTDIR	: directory containing all the relevant tests for each language supported for an assignment;
#			At the top-level of testDir, there would be language-specific folders. The contents of each folder are
#				setup/		contains input and file copying shell script for each test
#				tests/		contains the language-specific testing code
#							(in the code represented by TESTSETUP variable)
#				apart from the above, there would also be language-agnostic, IO check files put in
#				checks/		contains files for comparison of outputs
#   TESTSETUP : name of the test setup directory
#   TIMELIMIT : variable holding "Timeout" value from "testInfo" file
#   TESTNAME : variable holding "Test#" string from "testInfo" file
#   TIMEDOUT : exit code of timeout utility (124 - timeout, 0 - completed within time)
#   TESTMARKS : marks obtained in one test case
#   COMPILATION_STATUS : compilation status of the submitted solution files for a test
# All other variables are in lower case convention. They are:
#	  testInfo : file containing all the tests from the lab author
#			this file is common for all languages and is programming language agnostic
#			file needs to be formatted as tab-separated value file with three columns
#			Test# <Tab> Timeout
#			Ex:	Test1		1
#	  marks	: array containing marks from all the tests
#	  comments : "Wrong Answer", "Compilation Error", "Timeout", "Accepted"
#	    comments to be added in future: "Runtime Error", "Partial Answer", "Exception", "Files Not Available",
#			"Unsupported Language"
#	  testStatus : status comment of a test; used to look up code in "testStatusEncoder" associative array
#   logLength : stores the length of the log file specified by LOG
