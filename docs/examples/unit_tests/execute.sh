#
# Purpose: script invoked by execution nodes with one command-line arguement
#	   this script accomplishes one evaluation
#
# Invocation: $./execute.sh language
#		the language can be any of the following: java, c, python2, python3, cpp, cpp14
#
# Arguments: The first(and only) argument provides the language chosen by the student.
#            This will be appended to the the language specific compilation and
#            execution files.
#
# Dependencies: proper setup of test_cases/checks, test_cases/setup and test_cases/tests
#		see README.txt for more details
#
# Output:	results/log.txt		evaluation log
#		results/scores.txt	marks of each test case on a new line
#		results/comment.txt	comments of each test case on a new line
#
#	Variable definitions
#	--------------------
#	testLog		temporary test log file that holds compile and run-time logs from each test
#	log		temporary log file that collects compile and run-time logs from all tests
#	marks		array containing marks from all the tests
#	comments	"Wrong Answer", "Compilation Error", "Timeout", "Accepted"
#	comments to be added in future: "Runtime Error", "Partial Answer", "Exception", "Files Not Available",
#					"Unsupported Language"
#
#	testDir		directory containing all the relevant tests for each language supported for an assignment;
#			At the top-level of testDir, there would be language-specific folders. The contents of each folder are
#					setup/		contains input and file copying shell script for each test
#					tests/		contains the language-specific testing code
#								(in the code represented by testSetup variable)
#					apart from the above, there would also be language-agnostic, IO check files put in
#					checks/		contains files for comparison of outputs
#	testInfo	file containing all the tests from the lab author
#			this file is common for all languages and is programming language agnostic
#				file needs to be formatted as tab-separated value file with three columns
#				Test# <Tab> Timeout
#			Ex:	Test1		1
#
#	testName	variable holding "Test#" string from "testInfo" file
#	timeLimit	variable holding "Timeout" value from "testInfo" file
#
#	testStatus	status comment of a test; used to look up code in "testStatusEncoder" associative array
#	testMarks	marks obtained in one test case
