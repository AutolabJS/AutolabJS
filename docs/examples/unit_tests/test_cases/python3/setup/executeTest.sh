# script fragment used by ../../execute.sh to perform run-time tests. This script is not invoked directly
#
# All variables that are exported/imported are in upper case convention. They are:
#   TIMELIMIT : time limit in which the execution of this test should finish
#   TESTLOG : name of log file that stores results of a test
#   TIMEDOUT : exit code of timeout utility (124 - timeout, 0 - completed within time)
#   TESTMARKS : marks obtained in this test case
#   LOG : log file that stores results from all tests
# The environment variables are in upper case convention. They are:
#   PIPESTATUS : an array variable which contains the exit status of each command in piped commands
